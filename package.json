  "description": "We'd like you to create a URL shortening service. - It should have a route where you can send a POST request with a URL in the body, which returns a short URL. - When you send a GET request to a previously returned URL, it should redirect to the POSTed URL. - We'd also like a simple frontend that can create and display shortened URLs without reloading the page. - For simplicity, don't worry about persisting the URLs between restarts (ie, we don't need it to talk to an external database).",
